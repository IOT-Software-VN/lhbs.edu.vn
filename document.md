## Technical Architecture Notes

### State Management
- React useState và useRef cho local component state
- Framer Motion useInView cho scroll-triggered animations
- Form state management với validation logic

### Styling Approach  
- Tailwind CSS với custom color palette (#1a5336, #FABA1E, #fffae9)
- Responsive design với breakpoints: md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px)
- Custom fonts: SVN-Gotham cho headings

### Animation Library
- Framer Motion cho page transitions, scroll animations, hover effects
- Custom easing functions cho smooth scrolling
- Staggered animations cho list/grid items

### Performance Optimizations
- Image lazy loading với object-cover responsive behavior  
- Component-level state management để minimize re-renders
- Conditional rendering cho performance-sensitive components

### Navigation System
- TypeScript navigation types với NavParent và NavChild interfaces
- Dynamic routing với onNavigate prop threading
- Mega menu với category grouping và more links

## Development Guidelines

### Component Structure
```typescript
// Standard component pattern
interface ComponentProps {
  onNavigate: (path: string) => void;
}

export function ComponentName({ onNavigate }: ComponentProps) {
  const ref = useRef(null);
  const isInView = useInView(ref, { once: true, amount: 0.3 });
  
  return (
    <motion.section
      ref={ref}
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
      animate={isInView ? { opacity: 1 } : {}}
      transition={{ duration: 0.8 }}
    >
      {/* Component content */}
    </motion.section>
  );
}
```

### Styling Conventions
- Container max-width: `max-w-[1440px] mx-auto`
- Section padding: `py-24 px-4 md:px-12`
- Grid layouts: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`
- Animation delays: staggered từ 0.2s với increment 0.1s

### Form Validation
- Client-side validation với error states
- File upload với type restrictions và size limits
- Progress indication cho multi-step forms
- Accessibility compliance với ARIA labels
